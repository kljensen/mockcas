# MockCAS

A small "mock" CAS server that helps me test CAS
authentication while in development, instead of
using Yale's CAS service.

## Warnings ⚠️⚠️⚠️

* It only implements a very small fraction of the
  CAS flows: the few that I need for authentication.
* *Only* use this in development. The npm deps are
  out of date and it is not for anything related
  to production!
